# M0 Fix List - Android CI Setup

## Overview
This document details the root causes and exact fixes applied to resolve known blockers and set up CI for the FB Automation Android project.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. UTF-8 BOM in android-app/app/build.gradle

**Root Cause:** The build.gradle file contained a UTF-8 Byte Order Mark (BOM) at the beginning, causing Gradle parsing errors with "Unexpected character: '﻿'".

**Evidence:** Hexdump showed `ef bb bf` bytes at file start.

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed UTF-8 BOM from the beginning of the file
- Ensured file starts cleanly with `plugins {` block
- Maintained all existing dependencies and configuration

**Files Modified:**
- `android-app/app/build.gradle`

### 2. Corrupted FloatingButtonService.kt

**Root Cause:** The FloatingButtonService.kt file had orphaned/duplicated code tokens after the onStartCommand method, causing compilation errors. The method structure was broken with incomplete blocks and syntax errors.

**Issues Found:**
- Orphaned `}else {` block after onStartCommand
- Duplicated notification creation code
- Incomplete method closures
- Missing proper method structure

**Fix Applied:**
- Cleaned up the onStartCommand method implementation
- Removed all orphaned and duplicated code blocks
- Ensured proper method structure and syntax
- Maintained all required imports and functionality

**Files Modified:**
- `android-app/app/src/main/java/com/seqautomotive/fbautomation/FloatingButtonService.kt`

### 3. Missing CI Workflow

**Root Cause:** No automated CI pipeline existed to build debug APK on each push.

**Fix Applied:**
- Created `.github/workflows/android.yml` with comprehensive CI configuration
- Set up JDK 17 environment matching project requirements
- Added Gradle caching for faster builds
- Configured debug APK build and artifact upload
- Added unit test execution
- Set up proper triggers for main/develop branches and PRs

**Files Created:**
- `.github/workflows/android.yml`

### 4. AndroidManifest.xml Verification

**Status:** ✅ Already Correct
- All required permissions present (SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW, FOREGROUND_SERVICE, etc.)
- Service properly configured with foregroundServiceType="dataSync"
- No changes needed

## Build Configuration Verified

### Dependencies Status: ✅ All Good
- Room 2.6.1 with proper kapt configuration
- ML Kit OCR 16.0.0
- Coroutines 1.7.3
- All Android libraries at stable versions

### Gradle Configuration: ✅ Verified
- JDK 17 compatibility
- Kotlin compilation target correct
- ViewBinding enabled
- Proper namespace configuration

## CI Pipeline Features

The new Android CI workflow provides:

1. **Automated Builds:** Triggers on push to main/develop and PRs to main
2. **Environment:** Ubuntu latest with JDK 17 (Temurin distribution)
3. **Caching:** Gradle packages cached for performance
4. **Artifacts:** Debug APK uploaded with 30-day retention
5. **Testing:** Unit tests executed with results uploaded
6. **Error Handling:** Stacktrace enabled for debugging

## Verification Steps

To verify fixes:

1. **BOM Removal:** `hexdump -C android-app/app/build.gradle | head -1` should show clean start
2. **Service Compilation:** Kotlin compilation should succeed without syntax errors
3. **CI Execution:** Push to main/develop should trigger successful APK build
4. **Artifact Generation:** Debug APK should be available in Actions artifacts

## Next Steps

1. Push changes to trigger CI pipeline
2. Verify successful APK build in GitHub Actions
3. Download and test debug APK artifact
4. Monitor CI performance and optimize as needed
