# 🤖 FULLY AUTOMATED APK BUILDING - NO ANDROID STUDIO NEEDED!

## 🎯 **EASIEST METHOD: GitHub Actions Auto-Build**

I've created an automated system that builds your APK online using GitHub's servers. **No software installation required!**

### **📋 SUPER SIMPLE STEPS:**

#### **1. Create GitHub Account (if you don't have one)**
- Go to [github.com](https://github.com) → Sign up (free)

#### **2. Upload Your Project to GitHub**
**Option A: Use GitHub Web Interface (Easiest)**
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) → **New repository**
2. Name: `seq-fb-automation`
3. Make it **Public** (required for free GitHub Actions)
4. Click **Create repository**
5. Click **uploading an existing file**
6. **Drag & drop** all files from your `android-app` folder
7. Scroll down → **Commit changes**

**Option B: Use Git Commands (if you have Git installed)**
1. Open terminal in your `android-app` folder
2. Run: `setup-github.bat` (Windows) or `./setup-github.sh` (Mac/Linux)
3. Follow the instructions to push to GitHub

#### **3. GitHub Automatically Builds Your APK**
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Actions** tab
3. The build starts automatically!
4. Wait 5-10 minutes for completion
5. Click the completed build → **Artifacts** → Download **SEQ-FB-Automation-APK**

#### **4. Install on Your Samsung S24 Ultra**
1. **Download the APK** from GitHub to your phone
2. **Open the APK file** → Allow installation from unknown sources
3. **Grant permissions** when the app asks
4. **Done!** 🎉
